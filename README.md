stack-shelf
===========

A simple OpenSCAD model for small, stacking shelves.

The goal is to use these to organize game consoles, preferably
after fabrication costs are reduced to a lower order of magnitude
than the costs of the consoles themselves.

The pattern for just a leg is also included, since it may
significantly reduce cost to punch some holes in a sheet of 
acrylic and snap 3D-printed legs into them.
